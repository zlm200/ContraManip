# ContraManip

This is the official PyTorch implementation for the paper: **"ContraManip: Visual Contrastive Reinforcement Learning with Dual Data Augmentations for Robust Robotic Manipulation"**.

## Overview
ContraManip is a visual reinforcement learning framework that utilizes:
- **Dual Data Augmentation:** To generate diverse views for robust feature learning.
- **Contrastive Learning:** To enforce feature consistency and isolate interference factors.
- **End-to-End Training:** Integrating feature extraction (ResNet18) and policy learning.

## 📅 Coming Soon
The code is currently being refactored for public release. We plan to release:
- [ ] Training code for Sawyer robotic tasks in **Robosuite**.
- [ ] Evaluation scripts for zero-shot generalization.
- [ ] Pre-trained models.

**Estimated Release Date:** Feb 2026 (or upon paper acceptance).

## Prerequisites (Preview)
The code will depend on the following libraries:
- Python 3.8+
- PyTorch
- Robosuite
- MuJoCo
